# Udacity_Project1_Explore_Weather_Trend
This is the very first project of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree course.

## Project Summary
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live (in my case it's London, UK) to overall global temperature trends.

The whole analysis was performed in Excel.
